    "# Tutorial 6: trajectory optimisation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we are going to optimise the trajectory of a cannon firing a ball at a target.\n",
    "We are somehow limited by the capabilities of the python default solvers here, but this will be the opportunity to remind ourselves that non-linear programs are not things that are easy to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is thus the following:\n",
    "We need to optimise the initial velocity of a canonball such that it hits the ground at a specified target location.\n",
    "This is the illustration that we have seen a few minutes ago in class, which I borrowed from Matthew Kelly (his whole video is interesting if you want further details on trajectory optimisation):\n",
    "http://www.matthewpeterkelly.com/tutorials/trajectoryOptimization/canon.html\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, our state is described by 4 variables, $\\mathbf{z} = [x,y,dx,dy]$ which describe the 2D positions and velocities of the ball. \n",
    "\n",
    "The decision variables are the initial velocity parameters $dx_0, dy_0$ (we always start from $x_0 = 0, y_0 = 0$) as well as the total duration of the trajectory $t$. Therefore our problem has only 3 decision variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will first model the simulation of the cannon being fired, and then write our optimisation problem\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Writing the dynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "We can first compute the derivative of our state $\\mathbf{z}(t)$\n",
    "As usual let's import a bunch of useful libraries first and define a few variables:"
