    "# Inverse kinematics\n",
    "This notebook considers the problem of inverse kinematics, ie solving at each control cycle of the robot a quadratic program from the derivatives (jacobian) of the current state. It introduces the basic function to compute the Jacobians of the robot, and how to use them to compute an inverse-kinematics control law. One of the key difficulties is to understand in which frames each quantities is computed (this might be in the world frame, in the local frame attached to the end-effector, in some arbitrary goal frame, etc), as we should never mix quantities expressed in different frames. \n"

    "Finally, the log operator transforms a displacement M in SE(3) into the spatial (6D) velocity that should be applied during 1 second to achieve this displacement. The spatial velocity is expressed in the frame at the origin of the displacement (i.e. nu=log(oMtool) is expressed in the world frame F_o). In Pinocchio, the log returns an object of class Motion, that can be converted to a numpy vector."
